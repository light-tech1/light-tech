👩‍💻 About
I am a learner in the ALX Front‑End Web Development program, passionate about building accessible, responsive, and offline‑ready web experiences. I believe technology should serve everyone—especially learners in rural and underserved communities.
Why I started with software engineering: to create practical solutions for deprived communities. My goal is to bridge the education gap between well‑resourced cities and rural areas by building websites and apps that deliver quality learning content offline.
🌍 Based in: Accra, Ghana
🔭 Current focus: Front‑End, PWAs, service workers, caching strategies, and content packaging for offline use
💡 Interests: Inclusive design, performance optimization, and community‑driven education
🎯 Open to: Front‑end roles, internships, open‑source collaborations, and education‑tech partnerships

🎯 Mission & Impact
Mission: Build offline‑first, low‑bandwidth learning tools that democratize access to education for rural learners.
📶 Connectivity‑aware UX: Design for 2G/3G and intermittent networks.
📦 Content packages: Bundle lessons for offline viewing with background sync when online.
🧭 Usability: Simple, multilingual interfaces that work on low‑end Android devices.
🔒 Privacy‑first: Data‑light analytics and local‑first storage.
Inspiration: Learners in rural communities who deserve equal opportunities to learn anywhere, anytime.

📦 Offline‑First Toolkit
I design for intermittent connectivity and constrained devices. Here’s my go‑to stack for offline‑ready apps:
Service Workers (precaching, runtime caching, background sync)
IndexedDB for local persistence of lessons, media, and progress
Optimized assets (image compression, responsive images, lazy loading)
Lightweight UI with Tailwind and component reuse
Internationalization (i18n) for local languages
Sample service worker snippet
// workbox-powered example
import { precacheAndRoute } from 'workbox-precaching';
import { registerRoute } from 'workbox-routing';
import { StaleWhileRevalidate } from 'workbox-strategies';

precacheAndRoute(self.__WB_MANIFEST);

registerRoute(
  ({ request }) => request.destination === 'document',
  new StaleWhileRevalidate()
);
